    <h2>Challenge</h2>
        eBay, one of the world’s largest marketplaces, was initially built on Java over 20 years ago. As the company continued to grow into a global business, its environment has become more complex with the incorporation of an ever-increasing number of heterogeneous applications, from Kafka and Mongo to Cassandra and Elasticsearch. The company was in need of a better system for running workloads of different kinds on its internal private cloud.
    <br>
      <h2>Solution</h2>
        Aligned on the application-centric nature of Kubernetes, the cloud and platforms team spent six months in 2016 building a management framework for Kubernetes to operate at scale within eBay. Since then, about a dozen applications have been onboarded and are in development. In 2017, eBay plans to accelerate the adoption of Kubernetes, migrating as many as 100 high-value applications onto the platform.

<h2>Impact</h2>
      Suneet Nandwani, eBay’s Senior Director of Cloud and Platforms, has overseen the company’s cloud journey, from the building of its internal private cloud to the adoption of Kubernetes, and he is proud to highlight the impact of these changes. "We truly believe that today eBay is a more agile environment," Nandwani says. "Six years ago, it used to take us four to five weeks to deploy an application through our data centers. Today it’s pretty much point and click, and 30 minutes later you have an application deployed. For us, this shows our agility and the immediate ROI."<br><br>
      With the big ramp up of application migration to Kubernetes planned for 2017, he predicts that the rate and speed of innovation will continue to improve: "If we were having this conversation in 12 to 18 months, I would expect to say that it’s starting to produce a large amount of value for eBay."

  The way Suneet Nandwani sees it, the past six years have been nothing short of transformational for <a href="http://www.ebay.com/">eBay</a>. And that’s saying a lot for a 21-year-old company operating at hyper scale, with 169 million active buyers and a massive amount of engineering going on behind the scenes.<br><br>
  The company was founded with the core believe that it should use technology to empower and connect people, globally. Nandwani, now eBay’s Senior Director of Cloud and Platforms, joined the company in 2010, at a time when eBay early stages of its private Cloud journey. Nandwani states that "in the technology world, our founding principal translates to the notion that we should be a core contributor to open source technology and collaborate on the tools that are already out there."<br><br>
  A big part of eBay’s cloud journey was adopting <a href="https://www.openstack.org/">OpenStack</a>, the open source software platform for cloud computing, at scale, and as a result, "the rate of innovation has increased and the direction has changed, from a much more proprietary-based environment to a big focus on open source."<br><br>
  So, it should come as no surprise that eBay has now embarked on the cloud native part of its infrastructure journey with its investment in <a href="http://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a>, the open source platform for managing application containers across clusters of hosts. "At eBay, we are always asking, ‘How do we run things more efficiently for our infrastructure?’" Nandwani says. "We have been on the forefront of a lot of new technology. We want to be one of the first companies to be running Kubernetes at scale. And, given our company’s size and scale, it’s in core to our DNA to leverage these types of technology."<br><br>
  Embracing new technology meant that over the years, eBay has grown into a rather complex environment. Its traditional applications were built on Java, but teams working on supportive, internal applications were clamoring to use everything from <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Kafka</a> and <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">Mongo</a> to <a href="http://cassandra.apache.org/">Cassandra</a> and <a href="http://www.elastic.co/">Elasticsearch</a> and beyond. In short, the company needed a better story for running workloads of different kinds on its private cloud. "We are probably one of the largest OpenStack-based cloud deployments, and that helped quite a bit," says Nandwani. "But, it doesn’t help you all the way in running applications. eBay had invested in a platform as a service capability that we built for ourselves. But, this platform wasn’t generic enough or broad enough to be able to handle a variety of applications and&nbsp;workloads."

    "we saw an ability to run multiple and various types of workloads very efficiently and operate them really well. That was very attractive for the folks who are actually in operations and dealing with the manageability of the application. Kubernetes allows us to operate these applications in a much better way. We are able to scale our applications and monitor the entire ecosystem of what it takes to run an application and production at&nbsp;scale."

  Many eBay developers had positive experiences with technologies like <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> and were pushing the company toward microservices and container technology as a way to improve the developer experience. With Kubernetes, Nandwani says, "we saw an ability to run multiple and various types of workloads very efficiently and operate them really well. That was very attractive for the folks who are actually in operations and dealing with the manageability of the application. Kubernetes allows us to operate these applications in a much better way. We are able to scale our applications and monitor the entire ecosystem of what it takes to run an application and production at scale."<br><br>
  Before they decided to use Kubernetes, eBay first experimented with other open source cluster manager technologies . Nandwani’s team ultimately decided to go with Kubernetes. "I think Kubernetes has better abstractions, and it’s more application-centric, it resonated more with our developers," said Nandwani.<br><br>
  But it wasn’t a simple, turnkey integration. One of the big challenges was that eBay was not running Kubernetes on a public cloud, like most organizations do; that required some customization. Nandwani adds, "It turns out it’s not the easiest product to stand up at scale. The networking that Kubernetes requires is fairly involved, for instance."<br><br>
  Furthermore, Nandwani’s team made it a priority to create a seamless developer experience around Kubernetes. "There are things that the framework gives you, but we have to build on top of that," says Nandwani. "We need to make sure that we have a nice user interface, a good workflow, a good orchestration on top. And we also need a lot of ‘eBayisms’ to be in place, like monitoring, logging or the ability to get integration with OpenStack. We also had to invest a lot in management tooling on how to deploy Kubernetes, how to scale Kubernetes, how to have push button deployment and provisioning of Kubernetes clusters. Because of the scale at which we run, the operability features are very important." <br><br>
  Building the proper management framework was the first order of business—and a sizable investment the company made. Because it was so important for getting Kubernetes to run at scale, and there wasn’t already one available in the Kubernetes community, eBay is planning to open source its management framework, which is called TessMaster.

    A big reason Nandwani and his team are feeling so optimistic about Kubernetes potential at eBay is the community involvement around the technology. "We saw that happen in the early days with OpenStack; and, we’re seeing just as much—if not more—for Kubernetes," he says. "That’s really exciting because we don’t want to be alone on the journey. We benefit from the community as well as give back to the&nbsp;community."

    It took six months of engineering before the first developers were onboarded, and that process continues at a measured pace. "I think there’s frankly more demand for it internally, but we just don’t want people to prematurely come in and have a poor experience," says Nandwani. The company is also putting together a team of solution engineers to train its thousands of developers in using Kubernetes.<br><br>
    The next step was to select about a dozen applications to run on top of Kubernetes. Among them: <a href="http://druid.io/">Druid</a>, the open source analytics data store for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing">OLAP</a> [online analytical processing]; a framework for automating the company’s underlay networks. These projects have all been onboarded and are in development. For now, eBay has only dedicated six clusters of a few hundred servers each for Kubernetes deployment, which is pretty small for the company, but the company expects to expand into the thousands of servers.<br><br>
    "There’s been a fair amount of investment by eBay to do a project like this, but we’re not going to see significant returns for a while," says Nandwani. Still, "there’s been a lot of support from the developer community as well as from the leadership because I think there is a realization of how strategic this could be." The measure of success, he adds, "really translates into how fast the adoption of Kubernetes could happen within eBay. I’m not inclined to open the floodgates on this because Kubernetes still has a lot of maturing to do. But the framework and the benefits are going to be very significant. In 2017 we’re going to onboard projects that we expect to see a large amount of value—the few big ones where it’s a big problem to solve." One such project is eBay’s CI/CD [continuous integration/continuous deployment] framework, which is currently running on top of their OpenStack cloud, and will be migrated to Kubernetes. Another is an Artificial Intelligence platform that is being built for the company’s internal use.<br><br>
    The main pieces of the company’s cloud native stack are Kubernetes clusters leveraging Docker container engine with tools like <a href="https://prometheus.io/">Prometheus</a>, the open source monitoring solution. "We are using Prometheus to monitor the core control plane components of Kubernetes itself. We have multiple clusters in multiple datacenters, and having a collocated monitoring solution that scales with the cluster is a very interesting proposition considering the scale we are planning. When a cluster comes up, it comes up with Prometheus as an add-on, and the entire thing is automated."

    "We truly believe that today eBay is a more agile environment. A lot of times it’s hard to measure, but six years ago it used to take us four to five weeks to deploy an application through our data centers. Today, it’s pretty much point and click and 30 minutes later you have an application deployed. And that is obviously translating into a improved developer productivity. It’s really good for business,&nbsp;too."

We benefit from the community as well as give back to the community." Hence, the plans to open source Tess Master. "We have a very unique perspective of a large, mature company running an internal cloud," says Nandwani. "How Kubernetes should integrate with some of the large-scale platforms is really important for the community to know and recognize and accommodate in the roadmap."
 <br><br>
  So what are some of the lessons eBay has learned along the way that Nandwani can offer as advice to potential adopters? "We believe that to do cloud native well, you need to look at the entire ecosystem and not just at the cluster manager, like Kubernetes, or just Docker," he says. "What are you going to do about security with your containers? You need to be looking at deploying a good software registry service. You need to be looking at a good container registry story. Make sure that you can actually manage the entire lifecycle of your applications." Plus, "think carefully if you want to stand up your own Kubernetes clusters, because in my mind it’s not that easy to do at scale while considering multi-tenancy, security etc. Partner with somebody who’s really experienced in that. Unless you’re at a certain scale, look at a public cloud for a while. Running on Kubernetes is very attractive, but starting up Kubernetes itself is hard, especially at scale."<br><br>
  Looking back at the path eBay’s infrastructure has taken in the past six years, and forward to where it’s going with Kubernetes, Nandwani puts things in this perspective: "We truly believe that today eBay is a more agile environment. A lot of times it’s hard to measure, but six years ago it used to take us four to five weeks to deploy an application through our data centers. Today, it’s pretty much point and click and 30 minutes later you have an application deployed. And that is obviously translating into a improved developer productivity. It’s really good for business, too."
